ROS packages for the Summit XL robots of the University of Ulster, Intelligent Systems Research Centre, Cognitive Robotics Team.

This code can be used on a mobile robot for avoiding obstacles. This code was originally written for use
with a Summit XL mobile robot from Robotnik using laser readings as the means for determining obstacles.
However it can be configured to be used for any mobile robot using either laser and/or sonar readings.
It is based on the use of a potential fields algorithm in that it treats all obstacles as a potential
field. For more information please see the paper entitled "Biological Goal Seeking", submitted to 
ICRA 2017.
